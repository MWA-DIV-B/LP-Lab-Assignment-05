            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5</p>

            <p class=" sectionTag text-big">Transforming Education In India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools
                and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and
                proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary
                education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private management
                (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme
                and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two
                thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools
                in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower
                (36:66).[7]</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small ">As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all
                rural children between
                the ages of 6–14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrolment above
                96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year
                2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6–14 who are not enrolled in school
                has come down to 2.8% in the academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).[16] Another report from 2013 stated that
                there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from
                Class I to XII, representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19%
                increase in girl's enrolment.[17] While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education,
                the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system. While
                more than 95 per cent of children attend primary school, just 40 per cent of Indian adolescents attend
                secondary school (Grades 9–12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in
                India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day.[18]
                States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such
                schools.[19] The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that India is achieving only 79.0% of what
                should be possible at its level of income for the right to education
